\description{
First, it creates the cohort table. Note that this not the standard cohort table that is used in OMOP CDM schema, it is specifically created for this package amd later deleted.
Second, it loads cohort definition SQL file from the input path (given in trajectoryAnalysisArgs) and executes it in the database so the cohort table will  be filled in with event-periods that satisfy the cohort requirements.
The cohort_id of the built cohort is 1.
